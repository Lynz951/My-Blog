# August 26, 2022: My First Week of Bootcamp

## Q and A with Lindsay

* **Question 1: Was your first week what you expected?**

  * My first week of bootcamp was so busy. We had a death in the family that kept me even more busy than usual, so I was very strapped for time. I wasn't suprised that there was a ton of work, since I took Intro to Coding at Awesome Inc. last year and expected there to be a lot. 
 
* **Question 2: What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**

  * I am eager to learn more about the tools we are using, and more about Markdown. 

* **Question 3: What is something about you that an only be learned by reading this blog?**
  
  * Thank you for reading my blog. As a reward, I will tell you something that no one else on the planet knows. I drank drip coffee this morning for the first time in 2 years. I'm at an AirBnB at the lake and forgot my french press. It was terrible.

2. What are you struggling with?

3. How do you solve a problem?

4. What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
