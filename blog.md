# 2022-08-26: My First Week of Bootcamp

  My first week of bootcamp was so busy. We had a death in the family that kept me even more busy than usual, so I was very strapped for time. I wasn't suprised that there was a ton of work, since I took Intro to Coding at Awesome Inc. last year and expected there to be a lot. 
  
  I am eager to learn more about the tools we are using, and more about Markdown. 
  
  Thank you for reading my blog. As a reward, I will tell you something that no one else on the planet knows. I drank drip coffee this morning for the first time in 2 years. I'm at an AirBnB at the lake and forgot my french press. It was terrible.
