    <h1>August 26, 2022: My First Week of Bootcamp</h1>

    <h2> Q and A with Lindsay:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Question 1: Was your first week what you expected?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q> My first week of bootcamp was so busy. We had a death in the family that kept me even more busy than usual, so I was very strapped for time. I wasn't suprised that there was a ton of work, since I took Intro to Coding at Awesome Inc. last year and expected there to be a lot.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Question 2: What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</b></li>
        <br>
        </q> I am eager to learn more about the tools we are using, and more about Markdown. </q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Question 3: What is something about you that an only be learned by reading this blog?</b></li>
        <br>    
        <q>Thank you for reading my blog. As a reward, I will tell you something that no one else on the planet knows. I drank drip coffee this morning for the first time in 2 years. I'm at an AirBnB at the lake and forgot my french press. It was terrible. </q>
        <br>

        <ul>
        <li><b>Question 1:  What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q> I wish I could do the Grasshopper assignments without hitting the help button EVERY. TIME.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Question 2: What are you struggling with??</b></li>
        <br>
        </q>  I am struggling with a few things, one of them being mental fatigue. I am building my endurace for learning so much every day. I am glad that we have this time in Onboarding to work on this. </q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Question 3: How do you solve a problem? </b></li>
        <br>    
        <q>I have been solving problems by searching for answers online. I am trying to use slack more.</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Question 4: What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>If I get stuck on something I usually take a break and do something else for a few minutes. This helps me look at the problem from fresh eyes when I return.</q>
        </ul>

    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <h2>Q & A with Lindsay</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>I like using HTML and CSS better than just Markdown because I feel like I have more control over format. JavaScript is scary, but I can see the endless possibilities!</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>I don't know if there are any objects. Would classes count?</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</b></li>
        <br>
        <q>I love pseudocoding. As a visiual learner who loves writing things down to organize my thoughts, it just makes sense.</q>
